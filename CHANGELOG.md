## [0.5.1] (2026-07-17)

tmux-ws 0.5.1 is the installable corrective release for the tablet command
deck and touch-friendly context menus introduced in 0.5.0.

### Release status

The immutable v0.5.0 tag and release remain available, but their asset jobs
stopped at tag-message validation and attached no binaries. Use v0.5.1 for
installation. It contains the same tablet UI plus the repaired release path.

### Tablet and browser coverage

- Sessions and Windows use bottom menus sized for touch and small screens.
- Esc, Tab, Enter, arrows, and every Ctrl/Alt/Shift/Tmux combination send exact
  terminal bytes once per tap.
- Held arrows stop on release, pointer cancellation/leave, and browser blur.
- Playwright exercises 390x844, 768x1024, and 1024x768 touch viewports,
  including all 15 modifier combinations, latches, repeat lifecycle, native
  xterm virtual-keyboard input, WebSocket bytes, and browser errors.

### Install or upgrade

Verify downloads with `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing`. On Apple
Silicon macOS:

```bash

### Release reliability

Release tags are published through GitHub's annotated-tag and reference APIs
without broadening the org-wide App's permissions. Tag validation now reads the
tag object's contents directly, including API-created messages without a final
line feed.

### Included changes

- fix(release): validate API-created tag messages (7e511f0)


## [0.5.0] (2026-07-17)

> Publication note: v0.5.0 remains immutable, but its asset workflows attached
> no binaries. Install v0.5.1 instead.

tmux-ws 0.5.0 makes its tablet command deck dependable and adds browser-level
regression coverage for the no-keyboard workflow.

### Tablet controls

- Sessions and Windows open touch-friendly bottom menus, keeping their actions
  reachable on small screens.
- Esc, Tab, Enter, arrows, and Ctrl/Alt/Shift/Tmux combinations now send exactly
  one terminal sequence per tap. In particular, `Tmux` + `Up` no longer leaks a
  second plain `Up` after Chrome synthesizes a click.
- Held arrows stop on release, pointer cancellation, pointer leave, or browser
  focus loss, so a tablet cannot keep scrolling after Chrome is backgrounded.
- Modifier latches remain one-shot and can be cancelled without sending terminal
  input.

### Browser regression suite

The Playwright interaction suite runs at 390x844, 768x1024, and 1024x768. It
checks every direct command button, all 15 non-empty Ctrl/Alt/Shift/Tmux
combinations, latch cancellation and clearing, arrow-repeat lifecycle,
keyboard/assistive activation, native xterm virtual-keyboard input, exact
WebSocket bytes, and browser errors. Pull requests also publish an isolated UI
preview for real-device review.

## [0.4.0] (2026-07-15)

tmux-ws now ships reproducible x86_64 Linux packages alongside the existing Apple Silicon/Homebrew distribution.

### Linux packages

The release includes:

- `tmux-ws-0.4.0-x86_64-linux.AppImage`
- `tmux-ws-0.4.0-x86_64-linux.deb`
- `tmux-ws-0.4.0-x86_64-linux.rpm`
- the stable `tmux-ws.AppImage` download name
- `SHA256SUMS`

Verify downloaded assets before installation:

```bash
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing
```

For AppImage:

```bash
chmod +x tmux-ws-0.4.0-x86_64-linux.AppImage
./tmux-ws-0.4.0-x86_64-linux.AppImage --help
```

For Debian or Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install ./tmux-ws-0.4.0-x86_64-linux.deb
tmux-ws --help
```

For Fedora or another RPM-based distribution:

```bash
sudo dnf install ./tmux-ws-0.4.0-x86_64-linux.rpm
tmux-ws --help
```

### macOS

```bash
brew update
brew install lambdasistemi/tap/tmux-ws

### Release integrity

Linux packages are built and smoke-tested from the immutable `v0.4.0` tag. AppImage, DEB, and RPM contents are extracted and the canonical `tmux-ws --help` surface is exercised before publication. Historical releases, including v0.3.1, remain unchanged.


## [0.3.1](https://github.com/lambdasistemi/tmux-ws/compare/v0.3.0...v0.3.1) (2026-07-13)

### Corrective packaging release

`tmux-ws` is now the canonical package, executable, Darwin archive, Homebrew
formula, NixOS option, and systemd unit. The `agent-daemon` command and formula
remain only as a bounded migration route for this corrective release.

- **New Homebrew installs:** run `brew update`,
  `brew install lambdasistemi/tap/tmux-ws`, then `tmux-ws --help`.
- **Legacy Homebrew migration:** install `tmux-ws` first and migrate scripts.
  Then either upgrade `agent-daemon` to retain its temporary command alias or
  uninstall it after migration.
- **NixOS migration:** rename `services.agent-daemon` to `services.tmux-ws`.
  The compatibility option maps to the single `tmux-ws.service`; private
  account and state defaults stay unchanged to avoid disrupting upgrades.
- **Browser refresh after upgrade:** restart the daemon, then reload the
  browser document. The in-app **Refresh** action reloads tmux state, not the
  installed SPA document—this distinction matters on Chrome tablets.
- **Immutable history:** `v0.3.0` is unchanged. This release publishes the new
  `tmux-ws-0.3.1-aarch64-darwin.tar.gz` asset and updates the real Homebrew tap.
